👋 Hi, I’m an undergraduate student in the Department of **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/), currently serving as a research intern at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/uailab/home/">Ubiquitous AI Lab</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://taesikgong.com/">Taesik Gong</a>.

I am particularly interested in **On-device AI** due to its clear benefits for privacy and personalization. My research focus lies in solving the challenges of running AI efficiently in limited hardware environments (Hardware-constrained environments).

I’m also a strong **ESTJ**, with each trait scoring well over 90%. I enjoy meeting new people and maintaining a positive mindset. Feel free to reach out; I’m always open to a good conversation.
