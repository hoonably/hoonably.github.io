ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in Department of **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/).  

I'm interested in **On-device AI** because it has clear benefits for privacy and personalization. I'm particularly interested in solving problems related to running AI efficiently in limited hardware environments. 

Currently, I'm doing an undergraduate research internship at UNIST's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/uailab/home/">Ubiquitous AI Lab</a> with professor <a href="https://taesikgong.com/">Taesik Gong</a>, learning a lot and also doing some personal research.

Iâ€™m also a strong **ESTJ**, with each trait scoring well over 90%. I enjoy meeting new people, approach things in a highly practical and structured way, and try to maintain a positive mindset. Feel free to reach out; Iâ€™m easy to talk to.
