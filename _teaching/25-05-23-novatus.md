I assisted in the data preprocessing session, helping students during the lectures and hands-on exercises.

In the morning (3 hours) and a short afternoon session (1 hour), I supported the instructor by walking around the classroom, answering questions, giving hints, and checking students’ answers during small practice exercises.

After the main lecture ended at 2 PM, I <b>led a 4-hour practical session</b>. I had <b>prepared the practice materials myself in advance</b>, aligning them with the professor’s lecture content. These materials included <b>11 exercises</b>, and students who completed all of them were able to have their work checked and leave early.

During the session, I <b>answered questions</b> as they came up. After about 2 hours, I <b>started going over the exercises from Problem 1 onward</b>, providing explanations and solving them together with the class.

Whenever there was an unclear question or instruction, I made real-time announcements to clarify. After the class, I also <b>revised the problematic parts and shared the updated version</b> with all participants.
